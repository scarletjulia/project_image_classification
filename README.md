This project is [offered by Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/).

The goal was to read images into tensorflow, create and improve a Neural Network and display the results.   
In the model, 926 images of dogs of 5 different breeds were used, separated into 80% of the images for training and 20% for testing.
In order to manage the overfitting problem, augmentation was used, by flip, rotate, or zoom the images using Keras layers was possible to "feed" the model with
"new", treated images.
